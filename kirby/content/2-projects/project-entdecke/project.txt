Teaser: Object Design for Children suggesting a new Approach to explore Nature
----



Text: This canvas is a tool for kids to experience nature, especially the local forest, in an enriched way. Information and visualisations to different aspects of the forest are printed on the canvas. Similar to a picture book, the illustrations will act as a help and will remind kids about the information they have read beforehand during an expedition in the forest where discoveries are made. The canvas is water resistant and easy to clean. The material is very durable and specifically made to be played outside with.  It can be used in a great variety of ways: As a shelter, for sitting on it or as a tent. The canvas enhances and helps kids to find a new approach to be in nature and explore their surroundings.
