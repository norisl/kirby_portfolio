Ready, set, go! At the first Design Marathon in Switzerland, interdisciplinary teams are competing for the Designathon Award. You and your team have 48 hours to create a design!

Work-life-balance, 24/7-society, digital nomads, burn-outs: How do we adjust our work life in the future? The participants concern themselves with the topic «New Work» and delve into the subject throughout the event. The best projects will be selected by a jury and will be evaluated within a 1-minute presentation of each team. 

The Designathon 15 took place from 25th to 27th September 2015 at Toni-Areal in Zurich West.
